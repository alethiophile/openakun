* Things to do
** TODO Set up real per-instance configuration
 - Set database url, secret key?
   - This file may well end up with secret info in it, be careful
 - Not debug mode; that can only be set by the envar
 - Some verbosity level, though
   - Engine echo SQL?
 - Sentry DSN, once that's integrated
 - Password hash parameters (hash, security level)
   - Don't allow the known bad ones
 - Have a section Flask that gets dumped into flask config
** TODO Write view/post story functions
** TODO Write realtime engine
** TODO Figure out E-mail
 - How to test this?
 - Make it an optional item; if you want you can run an instance without using
   it at all
   - In that case, let users not provide it?
** TODO Write test suite
