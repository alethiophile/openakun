* Things to do
** DONE Set up real per-instance configuration
   CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 19:46]
 - Set database url, secret key?
   - This file may well end up with secret info in it, be careful
 - Not debug mode; that can only be set by the envar
 - Some verbosity level, though
   - Engine echo SQL?
 - Sentry DSN, once that's integrated
 - Password hash parameters (hash, security level)
   - Don't allow the known bad ones
 - Have a section Flask that gets dumped into flask config
** TODO Write view/post story functions
** TODO Write realtime engine
** TODO Figure out E-mail
 - How to test this?
 - Make it an optional item; if you want you can run an instance without using
   it at all
   - In that case, let users not provide it?
** DONE Write test suite
   CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 19:51]
** TODO Write a real frontend
 - CSS is awful
** TODO Make per-instance configuration better
 - How to find the configuration file?
** TODO Write more tests
 - Test the anti-XSS backend lots; look for lists of test cases
** TODO Figure out Sentry, add a setup
 - May wait until I've got a public instance
